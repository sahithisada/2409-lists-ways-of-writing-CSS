    <img src="./images/french fries.jpg"width="300px" height="300px"/>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">Recipe</h3>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">What you need</h3>
    <ul type="circle">
    <li>Potato – The type is important. Starchy, floury potatoes are the potatoes you need for crispy fries.</li>
            <ol type="i">    
        <li>Australia: Sebago (the common dirty brushed potatoes you see everywhere)</li>
        <li>US: Russet (also known as Idaho potatoes)</li>
        <li>UK: Maris Piper or King Edward.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Vinegar – For simmering the potatoes, it is one secret weapon for perfect fries. There is no trace of vinegar flavour once cooked. See Step 4 below for the why. </li>
    <li>Salt – For seasoning the water so the potatoes are seasoned all the way through.</li>
    <li> Oil – For frying. I use vegetable or canola oil which are neutrally-flavoured oils. Re-using the oil: The oil can be re-used 3 to 4 times, or more. It won’t even need to be strained. Just cool, pour into jars and keep in the pantry, and have a browse in this recipe collection to decide what to make next!</li>
    </li></ul>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">How to make it?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut fries</li>
        <p>First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little crispy fries trick you may not have seen before: use a serrated knife to cut the potatoes.
            Though not visible to the eye, it makes the surface rougher therefore creating more surface area to crisp up = crispier fries!
            What size to cut the fries: 6 mm / 1/4″ batons is the ideal size for optimum crispiness and fluffy insides. Thicker = less crispy. Thinner = not enough fluffiness inside.
            How to slice: Cut a whole potato into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick slices. Stack 2 or 3 slices then cut into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick batons.</p>    
    <li> Keep in water to prevent browning</li>
    <p>Keep cut fries in water to prevent them from browning as you continue cutting. No soaking time is actually required. A simple rinse followed by simmering the potatoes in vinegar water takes care of this for us.
    </p>
    <li>Rinse</li>
    <p>Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds. This is the first step to remove excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes (more on the “why” of this below, but in short it’s to aid crispiness – of course!). Meanwhile, the insides remain untouched by water so they’ll cook up nice and fluffy.</p>
    <li>Cook in vinegar water = superior crispiness</li>
    <p>Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn down to low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes. See below for the “why” for this step!</p>
    <li> Drain and dry</li>
    <p>Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the water into a colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on two tea towel-lined trays to steam dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry, the residual heat will do the job for us.</p>
    <li>Cooking vessel and oil</li>
    <p>
    Cooking vessel – Use a heavy-based, large pot that is at least 10 cm / 4″ deep.
    We need:
         <ul type="square">
        <li>Oil depth – 3 cm / 1.2″ of oil (1 litre/quart for the pictured 24cm / 10″ pot). It’s barely deep-frying, it’s more like shallow-frying!
        </li>
        <li>Safety headroom – 7 cm / 2.8″ headroom above the surface of the oil for safety purposes as the oil bubbles up quite a lot when we fry. ⚠️ THIS IS IMPORTANT! Oil overflow is a real risk if you do not do this. It’s scary and dangerous, as I found out first hand! Learn from my mistakes.
        </li>
        <li> Oil temperature – Preheat the oil to 205°C/400°F. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature. I use a Thermapen, see my Essential Kitchenwares post for more details.
        </li>
    </p>
         </ul>
    <li> Fry #1</li>
    <p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: For safety reasons, please follow the directions to pause 10 seconds between adding batches of more potato into the oil! As you can see in the photos below, the oil bubbles up quite high and vigorously as soon as you add some potato. If you add all the potato in one go, the oil will bubble up even higher and faster, which is risky. </p>
    <li> Cool 30 minutes </li>
    <p>
        Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and spread onto a paper towel-lined tray in a single layer. They will be pale and not yet crispy.
        Carry out Fry #1 for the remaining two batches using the same staggered approach (ie. 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) within each batch. Ensure the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before starting each batch. Then cool all the fries for 30 minutes on some paper towel-lined trays.
    </p>
    <li>Fry #2 – crisp them up!</li>
    <p>After cooling the fries, heat the oil to 205°C/400°F again. Now fry half all the french fries for 4 minutes until they are a gorgeous golden colour and wonderfully crispy.
        Remove with a slotted spoon into a large paper towel-lined bowl then repeat with the remaining fries.</p>
    <li>Seasoning!</li>
    <p>Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or your favourite fries seasoning while hot so the salt sticks. Toss, then serve! Remember, these fries will stay crispy for more than 15 minutes, though of course they are best consumed piping hot!</p>
    <h3>Seasoning options:</h3>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Salt – table salt or sea salt flakes. Larger-grained cooking or kosher salt doesn’t stick as well.
    </li>
     <li>Rosemary salt (recipe) – made with fresh rosemary. </li>
     <li>Fries seasoning (recipe) – a savoury fries seasoning blend.</li>
     <li>Nori seasoning (coming soon) – made with finely ground nori (dried seaweed).</li>

    </ol>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: chocolate;">II. CHEESE BALLS</h2>
    <img src="./images/potato cheese balls.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"/>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">Recipe</h3>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">What you need</h3>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Potato: Use russet potato for best result. If you don't know which variety you have in hand, avoid older and sweet varieties of potatoes as they are more likely to get mushy. Sweet varieties of potatoes have a sweet smell when you cut them if that helps you identify them./li>
        <li>Cheese: I've mentioned cheddar cheese in the recipe card but you can use any cheese that melts (bonappetit.com) well upon heating like mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Spices: You can always adjust the seasoning to your taste and skip chilies if making for your toddler.</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs, corn flour: Use any flour you have in hand like plain flour or gram flour.</li>
        <li> Eggs: If looking for a vegan option, use cornflour slurry to dip the potato balls then roll in bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Herbs: I like cilantro and green onion best and they are always in hand. Parsley, dill, or chives are other options for herbs.</li>    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">How to make it?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and boil potatoes in a large pot with salt until al dente. Remove the potato immediately from boiling water and let it cool naturally. Protip: Avoid leaving the potato submerged in the water for very long as it can absorb too much water and get mushy. Peel off the skin and mash potatoes until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add all ingredients of seasoning to the mashed potato and mix well.</li>
        <li>Cut cheese into 25 cubes. Season the cheese with chili, dried basil, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll out about 25 small balls from the potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Now insert cheese cubes into each ball. Make sure the cheese cube is completely covered with potato.</li>
        <li>Roll all potato balls first in cornflour.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs with salt, red chili powder, and water. Then roll each ball in egg wash.</li>
        <li>And then in bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>For double coating, dip each ball again in egg wash.</li>
        <li>And then in bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Place balls in the fridge for 30 minutes so they are firm.</li>
        <li>Deep fry potato cheese ball in small batches on medium heat for 2-3 minutes then increase heat and fry on high heat for 1-2 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="color:  chocolate;">III. ALOO TIKKI</h2>
    <img src="./images/aloo tikki.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"/>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">Recipe</h3>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">What you need</h3>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Potato, Aka aloo: I prefer older potatoes, russet will work well.</li>
        <li>Onion: You can substitute it with green onions for a twist.</li>
        <li>Ginger and garlic: Since we will fry the tempering so you won't have a raw taste of ginger and garlic paste. You can use ginger or garlic powder as well.</li>
        <li>Cumin and other Indian spices: The combo of spices is very good and gives an authentic taste. You can try other curry powder as well for a flavor twist. I've tried adding Maggi noodle tastemaker, and other spice blends too. You can substitute red chili flakes with red chili powder.</li>
        <li>Binding agent: We need a binding agent to hold the Tikki together. Any binding agent like bread crumbs and any flour like (oat flour, arrowroot powder, rice flour or gram flour) can do the job.</li>
        <li>Herbs: I love fresh coriander in all desi foods, but you can try dill leaves, curry leaves, mint or parsley as well.</li>
        <li>Lemon: You can substitute lemon with lime too.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(152, 35, 35)">How to make it?</h3>
    <ol><li>Remove potatoes immediately from the water and let them cool naturally in a colander. Peel and mash potatoes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan, and make tempering by adding all ingredients for tempering in a pan. Mix well and cook for 1 minute until it sizzles.</li>
        <li>Add the tempering.</li>
        <li>And remaining ingredients are bread crumbs, coriander, cornflour/cornstarch, chat masala, and lemon juice in the bowl. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Roll out 10 small Tikki from the prepared potato mixture.</li>
        <li>At this stage, keep Tikki in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes. (Keep in the airtight box if storing for more than 30 minutes.) Keeping it under a fan to dry is also helpful.</li>
        <li>Fry Tikki in very hot oil, and adjust the heat while frying as needed. Do not flip Tikki immediately after placing it in oil. Let it get firm. You may pour oil from the sides but do not disturb until Tikki is firm. Flip carefully after frying for 1 minute. Fry in smaller batches allowing ample space to flip and stir without cracking. Protip: You can coat with cornflour or breadcrumbs for extra crispy Tikki.</li>
        <li>Remove to a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Serve crispy Tikki with chutney and dinner rolls.</li>
